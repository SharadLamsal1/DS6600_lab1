I chose the license, Apache License 2.0 because it allows others to freely use, modify, and distribute the code for both commercial and non-commercial use and many redistribution of code cannot be made under a more restrictive license. If I had used the MIT license (like we did in the lecture), it would allow someone to modify and distribute the code under a more restrictive license.
